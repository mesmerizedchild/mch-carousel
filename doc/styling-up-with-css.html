        <h1>MCh Carousel: Styling up with CSS</h1>
        <p>Here you will find information on how to style up your MCh Carousel, together with usable examples of styling. If this page is your very first encounter with MCh Carousel, you might want to read the <a href="quick-start.html">Quick Start</a> first and take if from there [you will eventally land back onto this page...]</p>

          <div class="doc">
            <p>MCh Carousel reorganises the DOM heavily, turning the simple <code class="lang-html inline">div</code> element with a handful of child <code class="lang-html inline">img</code> elements, into an articulated DOM tree [or a lush DOM forest, if you prefer...]</p>
            <p>Understanding the DOM structure is essential to styling MCh Carousel, as it's not immediately obvious where each piece of information [that is, captions, buttons, hyperlinks, etc] ends up at run-time.</p>

          <h2 id="the-dom-tree">The DOM tree</h2>
          <div class="doc">
            <p>The view below represents the DOM tree that MCh Carousel builds at run-time. Select each node to read a description of what it is for and whether you can style it; expand the nodes to dig into the tree.</p>
            <p>It may look scary, but fear not, for it's not all that complicated after all...</p>
            <p>In general, you should be wary of styling the topmost layers; think of them a bit as the scaffolding that keeps MCh Carousel together and makes it what it is. They are styled in <code class="file-name inline">mch-carousel.css</code> and most of them should be left untouched.</p>
            <p> On the other hand, you have complete control over <code class="lang-html inline">div.mch-caption-cntnr</code> tags and their descendants [for styling your caption text] and on the <code class="lang-html inline">div#mch-buttons-pane</code> tag and its descendants [for styling the button panes].</p>
            <p>Other elements that might need your attention are highlighted in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

          <h2 id="the-button-panes">The button panes</h2>
          <div class="doc">
            <p>MCh Carousel has a set of built-in buttons that allow you to take control over the sideways flow of images; these buttons are <strong>always</strong> generated in the HTML code, but if CSS does not style them up, they are just hidden [as in the carousels displayed till now!]</p>
            <p>There are 3 button panes available, each of which may be made visible or kept hidden independently:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p class="list-title" id="slide-control-pane">Slide-control pane</p>
              <p>This pane comprises 2 buttons: Pause and Start. Their function is self-explanatory: if the carousel is configured to slide images automatically, the former button will pause the automatic slide, while the latter button will restart it. Clicking on Pause when the carousel is paused, or clicking on Start while the carousel is sliding images, has no effect. If the carousel is not configured to slide images automatically, neither button will have any effect either.</p></li>
              <li><p class="list-title" id="start-end-slide-page">Start-end-slide pane</p>
              <p>This pane consists of 4 buttons: Slide to first image, Slide to next image, Slide to previous image, plus Slide to the last image. The exact direction in which each button will slide the carousel depends on the value of the <code class="lang-html inline">dir</code> attribute, as discussed above. This pane is useful if you want to style the buttons up with elements that change their meaning depending on the reading direction; for example, using the text "Previous" or "Next" in the buttons.</p>
              <h3>YOU F**KING WHAT???</h3>
              <p>Displaying this navigation pane is usually mutually exclusive with displaying the left-right-slide pane.</p></li>
              <li><p class="list-title" id="left-right-slide-pane">Left-right-slide pane</p>
              <p>This pane consists of 4 buttons: Slide to the leftmost image, Slide to the image to the left, Slide to the image to the right, and finally Slide to the rightmost image. The direction in which these button slide is not dependent on the value of the  <code class="lang-html inline">dir</code> attribute. This pane is useful in case you want to style the buttons up with elements that unambiguously mean "left" and "right", for example, images of arrows pointing left or right.</p>
              <p>Displaying this navigation pane is usually mutually exclusive with displaying the start-end-slide pane.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both the Start-end-slide pane and the Left-right-slide pane might need direction-dependent CSS styling, if you intend to target both audiences, but the Start-end-slide may make matters a bit easier.</p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
